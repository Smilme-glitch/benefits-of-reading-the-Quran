    <h1>The Holy Quran</h1>
    <h2>ðŸ•‹ Brief History of the Holy Qurâ€™an
</h2>
    <p>The Holy Qurâ€™an is the final revelation of Allah (God) to mankind. It was revealed to Prophet Muhammad ï·º over a period of 23 years (610â€“632 CE) through the Angel Jibril (Gabriel). The Qurâ€™an is written in classical Arabic and contains 114 chapters (Surahs) and over 6,000 verses (Ayat).
The Qurâ€™an confirms the messages of previous prophets (like Musa Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù… and Isa Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙ‡ Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…) but also serves as the ultimate guidance for all humanity. It covers every aspect of life â€” from worship and morality to law and social justice.
During Prophet Muhammad ï·ºâ€™s lifetime, the Qurâ€™an was memorized by his companions (called Huffaz) and written on parchments, bones, and leather. After his death, the Caliph Abu Bakr Ø±Ø¶ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ compiled it into one book, and later Caliph Uthman Ø±Ø¶ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ Ø¹Ù†Ù‡ standardized the text and distributed official copies across the Muslim world.
Today, the Qurâ€™an remains unchanged since its revelation and is the most memorized and widely read book in the world.</p>
